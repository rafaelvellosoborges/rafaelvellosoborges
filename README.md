<br>
I'm Rafael Velloso, a 41-year-old professional with over 15 years of experience in management and entrepreneurship. From a young age, I was involved in the administrative operations of my family's business, building a solid foundation in people management, operational administration, and financial control.

Currently, I lead an Insurance Brokerage and a Travel Agency, and I'm in transition to a Full Stack Development career, with a focus on Front-End. At the moment, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm deepening my studies in Node.js, React, and TypeScript, aiming to develop scalable, high-performance solutions.

I'm driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and passion for technology â€” qualities that guided my entrepreneurial journey and now fuel my work in software development.

My goal is to integrate my management and business experience with technological innovation, contributing to modern, functional projects centered on user experience.

ðŸ“© Open to connections, collaborations, and opportunities in the technology field, where I can add value, continuously grow, and contribute to the development of impactful solutions.
